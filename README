This is a small project to get the Code coverage statistics for a project based on Emma Coverage Report.
It can be used to extract the statistics if you work in an org where the control over source path is not in your hand
i.e. you get the code coverage details of entire codebase.
Supported features:
* Get the list of classes with Zero code coverage (untouched by the execution: Unit tests/runtime)
To be added:
* Get the method coverage stats
* Get the line coverage stats
* Get the block coverage stats
